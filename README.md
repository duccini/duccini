## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Guilherme Duccini!

I'm a Front-End developer focusing on React.js and Next.js at the moment.

As a Freelance Developer in many projects I have to develop the Design and Backend of the projects, which gave me a good foundation in Node.js and Figma.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on React.js
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Three.js & Blockchain projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with System Design
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me how UX Design changed what I thought about FrontEnd.
